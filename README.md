# Image Super-Resolution Using OpenCV and Python Deep Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to enhance low-resolution images using super-resolution techniques implemented with OpenCV and Python deep learning. Low-resolution images often lack details and appear blurry, making them unsuitable for various applications. By applying super-resolution techniques, we can increase the resolution and quality of these images, making them more suitable for tasks requiring higher image clarity.

# Super-Resolution Models
For this project, we utilize two popular super-resolution models
EDSR (Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution): https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow/blob/master/models/
LapSRN (Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Network): https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-LapSRN/blob/master/export/LapSRN_x8.pb

# Libraries Required
OpenCV (opencv-python)
